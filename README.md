This is Arthur.

At its core this is a web scraper for IMDB using Python and lxml. It begins at a person's page, opens all the links in their filmography, captures contextual data about each movie -- the name, year of release, the poster, a truncated description, genres -- then opens the link to the full cast and crew and grabs that.

In the front end still to come, I wanted to show relationships over time between a specific person and the cast and crew members IMDB can tell me he encountered. 

With whom did he work most frequently? On what? How did that change decade to decade? What was his specifc role from movie to movie?

The gender pronoun there is intentional. This was written with someone in mind.

That's why this is called Arthur. Arthur Piantadosi was my grandfather, although I called him Doe. Just so happens he was a sound man.
